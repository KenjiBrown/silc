TODO/bugs in Irssi SILC client
==============================

 o Server password is not used at all.  It is not possible to automize
   the password authentication currently.  The silc_get_auth_method
   in irssi/src/silc/core/client_ops.c should find the connection's
   password, only if not found then continue resolving the auth method.
   Alternatively it can do it after resolving in the callback.

 o UTF-8 encode/decode WHOIS userinfos, topic, etc.

 o Testing


TODO/bugs In SILC Client Library
================================

 o The PRIVATE_MESSAGE_KEY packet is not handled (it is implemented 
   though).  This should be added and perhaps new client operation
   should be added to notify application that it was received and
   set the key only if application wishes to set (accept the key) it
   (Do this to 0.9.x).

 o Testing


TODO/bugs In SILC Server
========================

 o If client's public key is saved in the server (and doing public key
   authentication) then the hostname and the username information could
   be taken from the public key.  Should be a configuration option!

 o Backup router related issues:

 	o Add special handling in router and server for "connection
	  timed out" error.  Be optimistic.

	o Testing

 o Add a timeout to handling incoming JOIN commands.  It should be 
   enforced that JOIN command is executed only once in a second or two
   seconds.  Now it is possible to accept n incoming JOIN commands
   and process them without any timeouts.  THis must be employed because
   each JOIN command will create and distribute the new channel key
   to everybody on the channel (Fix this to 0.9.x).

 o Testing


TODO/bugs In SILC Libraries
===========================

 o WIN32 silc_net_create_connection_async does not work the same way
   than on Unix.  Do it with threads on WIN32.  The function works but
   is not actually async currently (Fix this to 0.9.x).


TODO in Toolkit Documentation
=============================

Stuff that needs to be done in order to complete the Tooolkit Reference
Manual (Do these to 0.9.x).

 o ROBOdoc documenting missing from lib/silcutil/silcbuffer.h.

 o ROBOdoc documenting missing from lib/silcutil/silcdlist.h.

 o ROBOdoc documenting missing from lib/silccrypt/silccipher.h.

 o ROBOdoc documenting missing from lib/silccrypt/silcpkcs.h.

 o Write "Programming with Toolkit" document, describing how to build
   Toolkit, how the build system works, where is everything, how
   new (external) projects can be glued into Toolkit (use irssi as an
   example), and how external projects can use Toolkit without gluing into
   it (how to link etc), debugging, architecture, types, etc.

 o Write "Platform Implementations" document to describe what platforms
   Toolkit support, what has been implemented, what has not been, what
   works differently etc.

 o Automatically generated index (would be nice).

 o Searching of predefined keywords, exact and partial matches (would be 
   nice).
