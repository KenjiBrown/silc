TODO in Toolkit Documentation
=============================

Stuff that needs to be done in order to complete the Toolkit Reference
Manual (Do these to 0.9.x).

 o Write "Programming with Toolkit" document, describing how to build
   Toolkit, how the build system works, where is everything, how
   new (external) projects can be glued into Toolkit (use irssi as an
   example), and how external projects can use Toolkit without gluing into
   it (how to link etc), debugging, architecture, types, etc.

 o Searching of predefined keywords, exact and partial matches (would be
   nice).
