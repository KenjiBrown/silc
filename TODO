TODO for SILC Client 1.0 branch
===============================

   parentheses are fixed.

TODO for SILC Server 1.0
========================

 o BUG: silc_idlist_del_client had been called but sock->user_data remained
   and pointed to invalid pointer.  Where it was called is not known.

 o Check for valid ban strings.  Check ban string notifying.

 o Basic UTF-8 stringprep profile that makes sure UTF-8 strings are
   as defined in spec-08 section 3.13.

 o Testing


TODO/bugs In SILC Libraries
===========================

 o Test cases for all payload encoding and decoding routins in lib/silccore/

 o Test cases for math library routines in lib/silcmath/

 o Implement new version of SFTP protocol (missing versions 4 and 5, we
   have version 3).


TODO in Toolkit Documentation
=============================

Stuff that needs to be done in order to complete the Toolkit Reference
Manual (Do these to 0.9.x).

 o Write "Programming with Toolkit" document, describing how to build
   Toolkit, how the build system works, where is everything, how
   new (external) projects can be glued into Toolkit (use irssi as an
   example), and how external projects can use Toolkit without gluing into
   it (how to link etc), debugging, architecture, types, etc.

 o Searching of predefined keywords, exact and partial matches (would be
   nice).
