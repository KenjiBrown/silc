TODO/bugs in Irssi SILC Client
==============================

 o UTF-8 encode/decode WHOIS userinfos, topic, etc.

 o Manaul file for silc(1) and silc.conf.

 o Testing - See test plan:
     http://silcnet.org/docs/silc-client-1.0-test.pdf
     http://silcnet.org/docs/silc-client-1.0-test.ps


TODO/bugs In SILC Server
========================

 o If client's public key is saved in the server (and doing public key
   authentication) then the hostname and the username information could
   be taken from the public key.  Should be a configuration option!

 o Backup router related issues:

 	o Add special handling in router and server for "connection
	  timed out" error.  Be optimistic.

 o Manual file for silcd(8) and silcd.conf.

 o Testing


TODO/bugs In SILC Libraries
===========================

 o WIN32 silc_net_create_connection_async does not work the same way
   than on Unix.  Do it with threads on WIN32.  The function works but
   is not actually async currently (Fix this to 0.9.x).

 o Private key encryption to silc_pkcs_[save/load]_private_key[_data]
   function.


TODO in Toolkit Documentation
=============================

Stuff that needs to be done in order to complete the Tooolkit Reference
Manual (Do these to 0.9.x).

 o Write "Programming with Toolkit" document, describing how to build
   Toolkit, how the build system works, where is everything, how
   new (external) projects can be glued into Toolkit (use irssi as an
   example), and how external projects can use Toolkit without gluing into
   it (how to link etc), debugging, architecture, types, etc.

 o Write "Platform Implementations" document to describe what platforms
   Toolkit support, what has been implemented, what has not been, what
   works differently etc.

 o Searching of predefined keywords, exact and partial matches (would be 
   nice).
