TODO/bugs in Irssi SILC client
==============================

 o /cumode for unknown nick does not give any error message (Fix this to
   1.0).


TODO/bugs In SILC Client Library
================================

 o The PRIVATE_MESSAGE_KEY packet is not handled (it is implemented 
   though).  This should be added and perhaps new client operation
   should be added to notify application that it was received and
   set the key only if application wishes to set (accept the key) it
   (Do this to 1.0).

 o Remove conn->current_channel.

 o Additions to do after protocol version 1.1:

	o Add support for list of errors in command replies.  Protocol
	  TODO entry 1.


TODO/bugs In SILC Server
========================

 o Configuration file additions (Do this to 0.8.x):

	o Add incoming connection frequency, incoming connection frequency
	  for single IP address, key exchange frequency, key exchange
	  frequency for single IP. Add also frequency base.

 o If server send CUMODE_CHANGE notify (like setting founder) to router
   and router does not have founder on channel (founder is left or there's
   no founder on channel at all), the router will accept the server's
   founder mode change, even though it perhaps should not do that (Fix 
   this to 0.9).

 o The router should check for validity of received notify packets from
   routers (fix this to 0.9).  Following NOTIFYs needs to be verified:

	o JOIN (check that joining is allowed)
	o SIGNOFF (maybe should check that notifier owns the client)

 o Backup router related issues (Fix this to 1.0):

 	o Channel user mode changes are notified unnecessarely when
	  switching to backup router on router crash.

 o Add a timeout to handling incoming JOIN commands.  It should be 
   enforced that JOIN command is executed only once in a second or two
   seconds.  Now it is possible to accept n incoming JOIN commands
   and process them without any timeouts.  THis must be employed because
   each JOIN command will create and distribute the new channel key
   to everybody on the channel (Fix this to 1.0).

 o Lots of statistics updating is missing around the server.

 o If client's public key is saved in the server (and doing public key
   authentication) then the hostname and the username information could
   be taken from the public key.  Should be a configuration option!


TODO/bugs In SILC Libraries
===========================

 o WIN32 silc_net_create_connection_async does not work the same way
   than on Unix.  Do it with threads on WIN32.  The function works but
   is not actually async currently (Fix this to 1.0).


TODO in Toolkit Documentation
=============================

Stuff that needs to be done in order to complete the Tooolkit Reference
Manual (Do these to 0.9 and 1.0).

 o ROBOdoc documenting missing from lib/silcutil/silcbuffer.h.

 o ROBOdoc documenting missing from lib/silcutil/silcdlist.h.

 o ROBOdoc documenting missing from lib/silcutil/silcfileutil.h.

 o ROBOdoc documenting missing from lib/silccrypt/silchash.h.

 o ROBOdoc documenting missing from lib/silccrypt/silccipher.h.

 o ROBOdoc documenting missing from lib/silccrypt/silcpkcs.h.

 o Write "Programming with Toolkit" document, describing how to build
   Toolkit, how the build system works, where is everything, how
   new (external) projects can be glued into Toolkit (use irssi as an
   example), and how external projects can use Toolkit without gluing into
   it (how to link etc), debugging, architecture, types, etc.

 o Write "Platform Implementations" document to describe what platforms
   Toolkit support, what has been implemented, what has not been, what
   works differently etc.


TODO in SILC Protocol
=====================

 2. Define that WHOIS and IDENTIFY commands must send list of errors
    if multiple Client ID (or Channel ID and Server ID for IDENTIFY) was
    requested and was not found.  Each unfound entry must cause an error
    command reply to the sender.  Also define that errors must be sent
    *after* sending successfully found entries (this way receiver may
    ignore them).  To be included in protocol version 1.1.

 17. Cell wide channel founder support, and permanent channels when
     founder mode set.

 24. Implement the <Requested Attributes> and the Attribute Payload to
     the core library, client and server.

 26. INVITE notify blocking by mode? Quiet user mode to quiet a user on
     channel, settable by chan op/founder?
