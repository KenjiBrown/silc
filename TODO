TODO for Irssi SILC Client 1.0
==============================

 o Testing - See test plan:
     http://silcnet.org/docs/silc-client-1.0-test.pdf
     http://silcnet.org/docs/silc-client-1.0-test.ps


TODO for SILC Server 1.0
========================

 o Fix CUMODE_CHANGE founder key things.

 o Backup router testing

   - test all resume error cases for backup router
   - test all resume error cases for normal server
   - test all resume error cases for primary router
   - test communication

   NOTIFYS

   Problems:

   - INVITE (and probably BAN) list notification from backup to primary
     after resuming does not work.  Primary does not get the list.

   Works:

   JOIN, TOPIC_SET, CMODE_CHANGE, CUMODE_CHANGE, CHANNEL_CHANGE,
   UMODE_CHANGE (rest of the notifys does not apply, no testing required)

 o Testing


TODO/bugs In SILC Libraries
===========================

 o Test cases for all cryptographic primitive in lib/silccrypt/

 o Test cases for all payload encoding and decoding routins in lib/silccore/

 o Test cases for math library routines in lib/silcmath/


TODO in Toolkit Documentation
=============================

Stuff that needs to be done in order to complete the Tooolkit Reference
Manual (Do these to 0.9.x).

 o Write "Programming with Toolkit" document, describing how to build
   Toolkit, how the build system works, where is everything, how
   new (external) projects can be glued into Toolkit (use irssi as an
   example), and how external projects can use Toolkit without gluing into
   it (how to link etc), debugging, architecture, types, etc.

 o Searching of predefined keywords, exact and partial matches (would be
   nice).
