 o Starting key exchange directly, rewrite. (***DONE)

 o Channel messages, channel private keys, channel entires, channel
   search, etc. rewrite.

 o For many APIs leave the hash context allocations to the caller instead
   of using client->sha1hash and client->md5hash, or some kind of thread
   safe (no locking) concept.

 o Key agreement rewrite. (***TESTING NEEDED)

 o Connecting to remote client (***DONE)

 o peer-to-peer private messages

 o Private message waiting API (in threads)

 o client_attrs.c, attributes rewrite. (***TESTING NEEDED)

   Convert them all to real lists and/or structures for easier use.
   (***DONE)

 o Nickname formatting rewrite. (***TESTING NEEDED)

 o UDP connections. (***TESTING NEEDED)

 o in /cmode and /cumode with +r, maybe the public key and private key
   could be just some "string", which would then match to "string.pub" and
   "string.prv".

 o All packet waiting timeout tests and error condition tests.


lib/silcsftp			****DONE****
============

 o Porting to use the new util library. (***DONE)


lib/silccore/silcpacket.[ch]	****PARTLY DONE****
============================

 o Implement silc_packet_engine_stop and silc_packet_stream_destroy.

 o Implement ACK packet and packet payload.

 o SilcPacketEngine. (***DONE)

 o New SILC Packet API. (***DONE)


lib/silccore/silcpacket.[ch]	****PARTLY DONE****
============================

 o IV Included flag support, UDP transport support (***TESTING NEEDED)


lib/silccore/silcid.[ch]	****DONE****
========================

 o Add silc_id_str2id to accept the destination buffer as argument
   and thus not require any memory allocation.  Same will happen
   with silc_id_payload_* functions. (***DONE)

 o silc_id_str2id, silc_id2str to non-allocating routines. (***DONE)


lib/silccore
============

 o All payload encoding routines should take SilcStack as argument.

 o All payload test routines into lib/silccore/tests/.


lib/silcskr
===========

 o Removing key from the repository is not possible currently.  It should
   be.


lib/silcske/silcske.[ch] 	****DONE****
========================

 o IV Included flag support in SKE (***DONE)

 o UDP transport changes; retransmission support by using exponential
   backoff algorithm. (***DONE)

 o SilcConnAuth header file documentation. (***DONE)


lib/silccrypt			****PARTLY DONE****
=============

 o Implement SILC Public Key Version 2 handling in sign/verify.  Implement
   Version (V) identifier (***DONE)

 o Add fingerprint to SilcSILCPublicKey and retrieval to silcpk.h.

 o Implement PKCS #1 sign/verify with hash OID. (***TESTING NEEDED)

 o Implement the defined SilcDH API.  The definition is in
   lib/silccrypt/silcdh.h.

 o SSH2 public keys support, allowing the use of SSH2 public keys in
   SILC.

 o OpenPGP certificate support, allowing the use of PGP public keys
   in SILC.

 o SILC PKCS (silcpkcs.h) reorganizing when other PK supports added.
   Move the SILC Public Key routines away from the crypto library into
   the core library (silccore).  silc_pkcs_public/private_key_* routines
   to silc_public/private_key_* routines.  The silc_public_key_* routines
   should also automatically handle SILC Public Keys, and other keys
   and certificates as well.  Add fe. silcpk.h into silccore.  It should
   also include the Public Key Payload encoding and decoding routines.
   (***DONE)

 o Add DSS support.

 o Assembler AES (***DONE)

 o ECDSA and ECDH.


lib/silcutil			****PARTLY DONE****
============

 o The regex code from lib/contrib might compile fine on all platforms.
   No need to make it silcutil/unix/ specific.  Add them to generic
   silcutil.c.

 o Fix universal time decoding (doesn't accept all forms) in silctime.c.

 o silc_stringprep to non-allocating version.

 o Compression routines are missing.  The protocol supports packet
   compression thus it must be implemented.  SILC Zip API must be
   defined.

 o Add builtin SOCKS and HTTP Proxy support, well the SOCKS at least.
   SILC currently supports SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 but it needs to be compiled
   in separately.

 o bool -> SilcBool (***DONE)

 o Silc FD Stream to WIN32 (lib/silcutil/silcfdstream.h)

lib/silcutil/silcbuffer.h	****DONE****
=========================

 o Remove the `truelen' field from SilcBuffer as it is entirely
   redundant since we can get the true length of the buffer by
   doing buffer->end - buffer->header.  Add silc_buffer_truelen
   macro instead.  Consider also removing `len' field too since
   it effectively is buffer->tail - buffer->data, and adding
   silc_buffer_len macro can do the same.  These would save
   totally 8 bytes of memory per buffer. (***DONE)


lib/silcutil/silcbuffmt.[ch]	****DONE****
============================

 o SilcStack aware silc_buffer_unformat (***DONE)

 o SilcStack aware silc_buffer_format (***DONE)

 o silc_buffer_format reallocates automatically (***DONE)

 o SILC_STR_OFFSET (***DONE)


lib/silcutil/silcstack.[ch]	****DONE****
===========================

 o Data stack implementation (***DONE)


lib/silcutil/silcstream.[ch]	****DONE****
============================

 o Add abstract SilcStream. (***DONE)


lib/silcutil/silcsocketstream.[ch]	****PARTY DONE****
==================================

 o Add SilcSocketStream (***DONE)

 o Add SilcSocketStream for WIN32

 o Handle EOS sending to upper layer properly

 o Test QoS after the changes made to socket stream


lib/silcutil/silcschedule*.[ch]		****PARTLY DONE****
===============================

 o Scheduler can be optimized for FD tasks by changing the fd_queue
   to SilcHashTable instead of using linked list.  We need to do
   one-to-one mapping of FD to task and hash table is more efficient
   for this usage.

   Also redefine the silc_select to perhaps return a separate
   structure of the events that actually occurred, instead of
   returning the events in the fd_list which is then traversed
   in the generic code to find the changed events.  This can be
   made faster by having own struct which includes only the
   changed events, thus the tarversing is faster since the whole
   fd_list is not traversed anymore (it is still traversed in the
   silc_select but at least it removes one extra tarversing later
   for the same list).

   Other task queues should be changed to use SilcList.  (***DONE)

 o Add SILC scheduler's internal routines into a table of implementation
   function pointers, that the generic code then takes as extern from
   implementation.  These are the silc_schedule_internal_* routines.
   (***DONE)

 o Change SILC_TASK_CALLBACK to non-static, and remove the macro
   SILC_TASK_CALLBACK_GLOBAL. (***DONE)

 o SILC Schedule API changes to WIN32.


lib/silcutil/silcasync.[ch]	****DONE****
===========================

 o Add SilcAsyncOperation to utility library.  Any function that takes
   callback as an argument must/should return SilcAsyncOperation.
   (***DONE)


lib/silcutil/silctime.[ch]	****DONE****
===========================

 o SilcTime. (***DONE)

 o system time, universal, generalized. (***DONE)


lib/silcutil/silcfsm.[ch]	****DONE****
=========================

 o SILC Finite State Machine API.  Replaces SILC Protocol API (***DONE)


lib/silcutil/silcnet*, lib/silcutil/*/silc*net*		****PARTLY DONE****
===============================================

 o Add UDP interface (***DONE)

 o Add UDP interface for WIN32

 o New network interfaces (***DONE)


lib/silcmath
============

 o Import TFM.  Talk to Tom to add the missing functions.  Use TFM in
   client and client library, but TMA in server, due to the significantly
   increased memory consumption with TFM, and the rare need for public
   key operations in server.

 o Change LTM and TFM function names when importing to SILC tree to avoid
   rare linking problems on system that has same named symbols already in
   the system.

 o The SILC MP API function must start returning indication of success
   and failure of the operation.

 o Do SilcStack support for silc_mp_init, silc_mp_init_size and other
   any other MP function (including utility ones) that may allocate
   memory.

 o Test on x86_64.

 o All utility functions should be made non-allocating ones.


lib/silcutil/symbian/		****PARTLY DONE****
=====================

  o lib/silcutil/symbian routines missing or not completed.
    (****TESTING NEEDED)

  o Something needs to be thought to the logging globals as well,
    like silc_debug etc.  They won't work on EPOC.  Perhaps logging
    and debugging is to be disabled on EPOC.


lib/silcasn1			****PARTLY DONE****
============

 o ASN.1 library (***DONE)

 o Header documentation missing. (***DONE)

 o Some string encodings missing (copy/paste matter). (***DONE)

 o Negative integer encoding


lib/silcpkix
============

 o PKIX implementation


lib/silcserver
==============

 o (Re)write commands/command replys.

 o (Re)write notify handling.

 o The SERVER_SIGNOFF notify handing is not optimal, because it'll
   cause sending of multiple SIGNOFF notify's instead of the one
   SERVER_SIGNOFF notify that the server received.  This should be
   optimized so that the only SERVER_SIGNOFF is sent and not
   SIGNOFF of notify at all (using SIGNOFF takes the idea about
   SERVER_SIGNOFF away entirely).

 o Another SERVER_SIGNOFF opt/bugfix:  Currently the signoff is
   sent to a client if it is on same channel as the client that
   signoffed.  However, the entire SERVER_SIGNOFF list is sent to
   the client, ie. it may receive clients that was not on the
   same channel.  This is actually against the specs.  It must be
   done per channel.  It shouldn't receive the whole list just
   because one client happened to be on same channel.

 o MAYBE: The SilcChannelClientEntry can be:
	SilcUInt32 address;
	SilcUInt32 mode;

  where address is SilcClientEntry address XOR SilcChannelEntry.
  You can get SilcClientEntry by doing client = chl->address XOR channel,
  and SilcChannelEntry by doing channel = chl->address XOR client.
  As long as the other pointer is always available when accessing the
  structure this can be done.

 o Add reference counters to all Silc*Entry structures

 o SERVICEs support (plugin, SIM)

 o If client's public key is saved in the server (and doing public key
   authentication) then the hostname and the username information could
   be taken from the public key.  Should be a configuration option!

 o Add a timeout to handling incoming JOIN commands.  It should be
   enforced that JOIN command is executed only once in a second or two
   seconds.  Now it is possible to accept n incoming JOIN commands
   and process them without any timeouts.  THis must be employed because
   each JOIN command will create and distribute the new channel key
   to everybody on the channel (Fix this to 0.9.x).

 o Related to above.  If multiple JOINs are received in sequence perhaps
   new key should be created only once, if the JOINs are handeled at the same
   time.  Now we create multiple keys and never end up using them because
   many JOINs are processed at the same time in sequence.  Only the last
   key ends up being used.

 o The CMODE cipher & hmac change problem (#101).
