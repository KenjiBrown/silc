SILC - Secure Internet Live Conferencing
========================================

[NOTE: SILC is still in middle of development and this package is known
as Developer's Version which means that the package is in no means stable
or ready to be in production use.  This package is for those who wants
to test SILC, find bugs and maybe contribute some time and code for the
SILC project.  There is no guarantees that this package even compiles and
even if it compiles there is no guarantees that it would work, and even
if it works there is no guarantees that it would work correctly, and even
if it seems to work correctly it may be just plain luck.]


Description
===========

SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a protocol which provides
secure conferencing services in the Internet over insecure channel.
SILC is IRC like softwarre although internally they are very different.
Biggest similarity between SILC and IRC is that they both provide
conferencing services and that SILC has almost same commands as IRC.  Other
than that they are nothing alike.  Biggest differences are that SILC is 
secure what IRC is not in any way.  The network model is also entirely
different compared to IRC.


Running SILC
============

The development version is still preliminary version and requires some
work to get it working.  You should, first of all, check the example
configuration files in ./doc/ directory.  Change them according to your
needs.

To run SILC client:

	cd silc
	./silc -f <config file>

To run SILC server

	cd silcd
	./silcd -f <config file>


Working Commands
================

Following commands has been, at least partly, implemented:


	/SERVER [<server>[:<port>]]

		Connects to remote SILC server.

	/NICK   [<nickname>]

		Changes/sets nickname.  Note that in SILC there can be
		multiple same nicknames.  However, the logic on working
		with multiple nicknames on user interface is pretty much
		still missing.  Also note that nicknames in SILC are
		case-sensitive.

	/JOIN   <channel>

		Joins to a channel.  Channel names start with `#'
		character.

	/LEAVE	<channel>

		Leaves the channel.  If /leave * is given the client
		leaves the current channel.

	/CMODE	<channel> +|-<modes> [{ <arguments>}]

		Changes/sets channel mode.  Most of the modes require
		special privileges, such as channel operator or channel
		founder privileges to work.  The mode is added by adding
		+ before the option(s) and removed by adding - before
		the option(s).  Following modes are available:

		p		Set/unset channel as private channel
		s		Set/unset channel as secret channel
		k		Set/unset that channel uses private channel key
		i		Set/unset channel as invite only channel
		t		Set/unset that only channel operator or 
				founder may set channel topic
		l <limit>	Set/unset channel's user limit
		a <passphrase>	Set/unset passphrase for channel that must
				be provided when joining to the channel.
		b <username!nickname@server>	
				Add client to/remove client from ban list
		I <username!nickname@server>	
				Add client to/remove client from invite list
		c <cipher>[:<keylen>]
				Set/unset channel's cipher

		Multiple modes can be set/unset at once if the modes does not
		require any arguments.  If mode requires an argument then only
		one mode can be set at once.

	/CUMODE	<channel> +|-<modes> <nickname>[@<server>]

		Changes/set user's mode on a channel.  Most of the modes 
		require that the client who changes some client's mode must
		be channel founder or channel operator.  Following channel
		user modes are available:

		a <nickname>[@<server>]
				Set/unset all modes (cannot be used to set
				both founder and operator rights, can be used
				only to remove both modes at once).
		f <nickname>[@<server>]
				Unset channel founder.  Channel founder rights
				cannot be set by user (only by server) so this
				can be used only to unset the mode.
		o <nickname>[@<server>]
				Set/unset channel operator.  Requires that 
				you are channel operator or channel founder.

	/MSG    <nickname> <message>

		Sends private message to remote client.  Support for
		handling multiple same nicknames with /MSG command is
		still missing.

	/WHOIS  <nickname>[@<server>] [<count>]

		Gives a little information about a client.  Support for
		handling multiple same nicknames with this command is
		still missing.

        /KICK   <channel> <nickname>[@<server>] [<comment>]

                Kicks client from channel. You have to be at least channel
		operator to be able to kick client from channel.  Note:
		you cannot kick channel founder even if you are channel
		operator.

	/PING	[<server>]

		Pings server.  Only locally connected server may be 
		pinged.

	/INFO 	[<server>]

		Requests information about a server.  If argument is
		not specified current server is used.

	/AWAY	[<message>]

		Sets away message.  When private message is received and
		away message is set the client automatically replies to
		the sender with the away message.  To remove away message
		give the command without arguments.

	/QUIT

		Quits session.  Connection to remote server is closed.

	/CLEAR

		Clears current screen.

	/VERSION

		Shows client version.


Features
========

Features to be included into the final release of SILC.  [Note that the
current Developer's Version does not include all of these features, read
TODO file for more information.]

 o Normal conferencing services such as private messages, channels,
   channel messages, etc.  All traffic is secured and authenticated.

 o No unique nicknames.  There can same nicknames in SILC without
   collisions.  SILC has unique Client ID's, Server ID's and Channel ID's
   to assure that there are no collisions.

 o Secure key exchange and authentication protocol.  SILC Key Exchange
   protocol provides key material used in the SILC sessions in secure
   manner.  The protocol is immune for example to man-in-the-middle 
   attacks.  The SILC Authentication protocol provides strong 
   authentication.  Authentication may be based on passphrase or public
   key (RSA) authentication.  For clients there is an option not to
   use authentication when connecting to servers.

 o All traffic is encrypted and authenticated using the best cryptographic
   algorithms out there.  Command messages, private messages and channel
   messages are all protected by encryption.  User can set private keys
   for both private message and for channels so that even SILC servers do
   not know the keys.  Cipher keys are, by default, 128 bits in length and
   public keys, by default, 1024 bits in length.

 o Supports data compression with GZIP to improve performance.

 o Supports SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 firewall traversal protocols.

 o SIM (SILC Module) support.  Support for loading of shared objects at 
   run-time that provides new and extended features to both SILC client
   and server.  These can provide extra ciphers and extra features to
   the software.

 o SILC client can be installed and used without root privileges.

 o SILC client can be configured by system wide configuration files but
   with user specific configuration files as well.


History
=======

Even though SILC were just released to the public the idea and the protocol
itself is quite old.  I got the idea about SILC in its current form in
the year 1996 and first lines of codes were written in early 1997.  This
release is now third rewrite of the SILC.  The very first version were
written in 1997 and it included SILC client and very very preliminary
SILC server.  The server actually weren't usable but the client looked
pretty much the same as it does now.  At that time the SILC also included
RSA implementation and 3DES implementation.  The random number generator
that exists in this current release is actually based on the RNG written
in 1997.  The RNG written in 1997, on the other hand, were based on
the SSH's random number generator.  The RNG has been rewritten twice
since the first version.

I stopped writing the SILC later in 1997 when I got busy at school and
in work.  The pause lasted several months.  The development resumed in
1998 when my friend (Juha Räsänen) and I implemented ElGamal algorithm.
I rewrote some other parts as well.  However, for the same reasons as
previously the development stopped again.  I resumed the development
later in 1998 by doing rewrite of the SILC in C++.  This was obviously 
a mistake but at that time it seemed like a good idea.  Again, in the 
winter 1999 I got very busy writing my thesis and was forced to stop the 
development again.  I also, started a new job in the spring.

Later, in 1999, I decided that this time I'm going to make it the right
way.  C++ was obviously a bad choice so I decided to fall back to plain
C language.  I also decided to do complete rewrite and started doing
more thorough planning of what the SILC actually should include.  I also
decided that this time it is going to kill me before I stop the 
development.  I started writing SILC in the weekends and actually 
everytime I had some spare time.  I also started a new job but I didn't
let that get to my way.  The result of this development effort is the
release now in public.

I've learned a lot by doing the SILC.  I guess, when I started it I wasn't
that good of a C programmer.  That alone was a reason why SILC hasn't
seen the day of light before now.  My programming style has also changed 
dramatically during these years.  Actually, it has changed couple times 
since this last rewrite as well.  However, the code style of current SILC 
release is quite consistent (actually the coding style SILC has been 
written now I've learned in my current job).

There is probably over 85% of new code in this third rewrite.  Rest has 
just been copied from the old versions and only minor changes has been
made (like changed function names and overall coding style).  I've 
preserved the dates of the old files (dating back to 1997) that has 
existed in some forms in the old versions.  There is a lot of new code but
already I see a lot that needs rewriting.  The development continues.
