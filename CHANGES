	* Fixed screen refresh.

	* Fixed channel joining bug from client.  On some circumstances
	  client tried to join to a channel it had already joined.

	* Added public key verification process into client's protocol.c.
	  The client now verifies the public key from user and saves
	  it into ~./silc/serverkeys/ directory. 

	  Added into: clientutil.[ch]: silc_client_verify_server_key.

	* Changed SKE protocol's silc_ske_initiator_finish function
	  to accept callback function that verifies the received public
	  key.  Removed old silc_ske_verify_public_key function.

Wed Jul  5 19:19:02 EEST 2000  Pekka Riikonen <priikone@poseidon.pspt.fi>

	* Added into silcpkcs[ch]: silc_pkcs_public_key[_data]_set and
	  silc_pkcs_private_key[_data]_set.

	* Made the password and public authentication more cleaner in
	  server's protocol.c.

	* Removed historic and obsolete protocol `channel_auth' from
	  both client and server.

	* Removed wrong way of sending command status messages from
	  server to client in server's command.c.  The old way violated
	  protocol specification.  

	  Changes to silccore/silccommand.[ch]: removed
	  silc_command_encode_status_payload -> not needed anymore,
	  changed silc_command_encode_payload_va to accept extra
	  argument on variable argument list.  The argument type must
	  now be provided to the function.  Also, added new function:
	  silc_command_encode_reply_payload_va which is same as
	  normal command_encode_payload_va except command status type
	  is provided as extra argument.

Tue Jul  4 18:26:39 EEST 2000  Pekka Riikonen <priikone@poseidon.pspt.fi>

	* Added ~./silc directory handling.  The directory includes the
	  public and private keys for the client.

	  Added silc_client_check_silc_dir, silc_client_create_identifier
	  and silc_client_load_keys.

	* Implemented SILC protocol compliant public key.  Added public
	  and private key saving to and loading from files.

	  Added into silcpkcs.[ch]: silc_pkcs_encode_identifier,
	  silc_pkcs_public_key_encode[_data], silc_pkcs_public_key_decode,
	  silc_pkcs_private_key_encode[_data], silc_pkcs_private_key_decode,
	  silc_pkcs_public_key_alloc, silc_pkcs_public_key_free,
	  silc_pkcs_private_key_alloc and silc_pkcs_private_key_free.

	  Implemented: silc_pkcs_save_[public/private]_key[_data] and
	  silc_pkcs_load_[public/private]_key.

Mon Jul  3 18:51:27 EEST 2000  Pekka Riikonen <priikone@poseidon.pspt.fi>

	* Added silc_server_get_route (route.[ch]) to get connection
	  data for the fastest route for given ID.

	* Implemented INVITE command on client and server.  The command
	  were re-defined in the SILC Protocol Specification and the
	  implementation now complies with the specification.

	* Implemented PING command on client and server.

	* Implemented NAMES command on client and server.  The server side
	  supports currently only normal server not router server yet.
	  Some changes to NAMES definition in SILC protocol specification.

Sun Jul  2 18:23:01 EEST 2000  Pekka Riikonen <priikone@poseidon.pspt.fi>

	* Implemented LEAVE command on client and server.

	* Previously deprecated SILC_PACKET_FORWARDED flag is now in use 
	  again.  This change was made to the protocol as well.  Server
	  should not violate the protocol specification anymore.

Fri Jun 30 14:03:26 EEST 2000  Pekka Riikonen <priikone@poseidon.pspt.fi>

	* Added SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 support to SILC client.  SOCKS5
	  was tested.  SOCKS4 was not but should work anyway.
