	* Implemented LEAVE command on client and server.

	* Previously deprecated SILC_PACKET_FORWARDED flag is now in use 
	  again.  This change was made to the protocol as well.  Server
	  should not violate the protocol specification anymore.

	* Added SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 support to SILC client.  SOCKS5
