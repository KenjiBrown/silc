<b>Introduction</b>

<br /><br />
SILC SSH2 Library provides SSH2 public key and private key support for 
applications.  The SILC SSH Library has been integrated to the SILC Crypto 
Toolkit allowing easy use of the SSH keys through the generic SILC PKCS 
API.  The library also provides an interface for low level API to directly 
manipulate the SSH keys.
 
The library supports creation of new SSH2 key pairs, encryption, 
decryption, signatures and verification.  Both RSA and DSS SSH2 keys are 
supported.  The library supports the standard SSH2 public key file format 
defined in RFC 4716 and the OpenSSH public key file format.  The private 
key file format support includes OpenSSH private key files.

The SILC SSH2 Library does not include any other aspect of SSH2 protocol.  
Only the SSH2 public keys and private keys are supported.
