<BR /><BR />
SILC Client Library is SILC Client implementation without the actual user 
interface. The library uses common and core components of SILC protocol from
lib/silccore library and normal utility routines from lib/silcutil library.
The library has been designed to be complete SILC Client implementation
without actual user interface.  The library provides the API for the
application which it can use to implement generally whatever user interface
it wants.

<BR /><BR />
The `silcapi.h' file defines the function prototypes that application must
implement in order to be able to create the user interface with the
library.  The idea is that the application can implement whatever user
interface routines in the functions and display the data whatever way
it wants.  The library is entirely transparent to the user interface and
it does not include any user interface specific issues such as window
handling or item handling on the screen etc.  These does not interest
the library.
