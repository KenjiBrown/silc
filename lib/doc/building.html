<big><b>Building the Toolkit</b></big>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
SILC Toolkit works on various platforms, such as on several Unix systems and 
on Windows.  Building of the Toolkit on some platform may differ from the
other.  This document describes how to build the Toolkit from the sources,
to create linkable libraries and binaries, on all platforms the Toolkit
support.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The building instructions for all platforms are also included in the Toolkit
package.  Please refer to the INSTALL file for general building instructions
for Unix systems, README.WIN32 for building on Windows systems, and
README.MACOSX for building on Mac OS X.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
Building the Toolkit on Unix will produce binaries of all libraries, and
SILC Client and SILC Server.  The Toolkit package includes also Client and
Server as an example applications, and they are compiled automatically.
The libraries are compiled to provide staticly linkable libraries.  Two
libraries are produced: libsilc.a and libsilcclient.a.  The libsilc.a includes
everything else except the Client library.  The libsilcclient.a includes
only the Client library.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
To build Toolkit on Unix systems, give commands:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>
./configure<br />
make
</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
On some systems you may need to give "gmake" command instead of "make".  The
./configure can take several options as arguments.  To see them all give
command:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>./configure --help</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The most important configuration options you may consider to use are:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>--enable-debug</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
If you would like to enable the debugging for the compiled binaries
you can give this option to the `configure'.  It is recommended to use
this option when you are doing development with Toolkit.  It is helpful
to enable run-time debugging.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>--with-gmp=PATH</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
If you wish to use GMP library for arbitrary precision arithmetic
library instead of using the MPI library included in the package, you can
give the --with-gmp=PATH option to the `configure'.  The PATH is the path
to the GMP library in your system.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>--disable-asm</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
If you have trouble compiling the assembler optimized code in the
package or does not want to use them, you can give the --disable-asm
option to the `configure' script.  This will assure that assembler
optimized code is not compiled in.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>--disable-threads</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
If you do not want to compile the programs with multi threads support
you can give --disable-threads option.  This will disable the SILC Thread
API and SILC Mutex API.  Furthermore if SILC Thread API is used when this
option is used, the routines work, but do not work in threads (are run
in the calling process and can block the process).

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>--enable-ipv6</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The `configure' will attempt to check for IPv6 support in your system.
However, if it fails, but you still want to compile in the IPv6 support
you can give --enable-ipv6 option to force the IPv6 support.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
After compilation you can install the Toolkit into your system by giving
the command:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>make install</tt>


<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b><a name="windows"></a>Building on Windows</b>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The Toolkit can be compiled several different ways on Windows.  However,
this document describes the method to build the Toolkit to produce native
Win32 binaries.  The Toolkit package can also be compiled on Cygwin and
MinGW.  For these systems please refer to the README.WIN32 file in the
Toolkit package.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The Toolkit package includes ready MSVC++ Workspace files, that will 
automatically compile the Toolkit.  The MSVC++ workspace and project files
resides in the win32/ subdirectory of the Toolkit package.  The `silc.dsw'
file is the workspace file that automatically supports compiling the Toolkit
and to generate the SILC Core DLL and SILC Client DLL libraries.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The SILC Core DLL is named as libsilc and will generate libsilc.dll, and
the SILC Client DLL is named as libsilcclient and will generate
libsilcclient.dll.  Both of the projects also automatically generates
libsilc.lib and libsilcclient.lib import libraries that may be used to
link against a client application.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
Generally you do not need to do any specific settings to compile the
Toolkit.  However, you must compile the libsilc before compiling the
libsilclient, since the SILC Client DLL depends on the SILC Core DLL.
You may compile the DLLs as either Release or Debug version.  Just select
the preferred method of compilation.  The Debug version will compile the
SILC Toolkit with run-time debugging support, which is recommended when
doing development with the Toolkit.

<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b><a name="macosx"></a>Building on Mac OS X</b>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
Building the Toolkit on Mac OS X is almost identical on compiling on Unix
system.  The reason for this is that the Mac OS X is Unix based operating
system.  To build the Toolkit on Mac OS X, give the following commands:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>
setenv CFLAGS -no-cpp-precomp<br />
./configure powerpc<br />
make
</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The ./configure can take several options as arguments.  To see them all give
command:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>./configure --help</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
If you do not want to compile the applications, or they do not compile on
your system, you can also choose to compile only the libraries, and skip
all applications.  In this case, before giving the "make" command, go
to the lib/ subdirectory, and give "make" command there:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>
cd lib/<br />
make
</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
After compilation you can install the Toolkit into your system by giving
the command:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>make install</tt>
