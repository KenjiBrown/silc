<big><b>SilcNotifyType Arguments</b></big>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The SILC Client Library 'notify' client operation (which is part of the
<a href="silcclient-SilcClientOperations.html">
SilcClientOperation</a> callback functions) returns different kind of
notifications from the SILC server to the SILC client.  The 'notify'
client operation implementation has a variable argument list to deliver
<a href="silcnotify-SilcNotifyType.html">SilcNotifyType</a> type specific arguments to the application.  This document
describes these arguments for all notify types to help SILC client
software developers to handle the incoming notifications.

<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>notify Client Library operation</b>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The 'notify' client operation callback function prototype is as follows:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;void (*notify)(SilcClient client, SilcClientConnection conn,
SilcNotifyType type, ...);
</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The first argument 'client' is the SILC Client Library context, the `conn' 
is the context for the connection to the remote server, and the `type' is 
the notify type enumeration sent by the server.  Rest of the arguments are 
`type' specific and implementation should handle them by the 
SilcNotifyType for example in a <tt>switch</tt> statement.  The notify 
types are defined in lib/silccore/silcnotify.h header file.  A short 
example:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;switch(type)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_NONE:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_INVITE:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_JOIN:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>Arguments</b>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The following table describes all notify types and arguments that the 
client library sends in the 'notify' client operation to the application.  
By default all arguments that the libary sends to application are valid 
pointers.  However, it is possible that some pointers may be NULL.  If 
this is the case it is separately mentioned that the argument may be NULL.  
In this case application must ignore that argument.  The SilcNotifyType 
arguments per notify type is as follows:

SILC_ID_CLIENT SilcClientEntry, for SILC_ID_SERVER SilcServerEntry and for 
SILC_ID_CHANNEL SilcChannelEntry.

the old nickname and the 'new_client_entry' includes the new nickname.  
Application must understand that the 'old_client_entry' pointer becomes 
invalid after returning from the function.

safely ignore it when received.
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><small>SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_SERVER_SIGNOFF</td>

<tr>
<td><small>SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_KICKED</td>

<td><small>SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_WATCH</td>
<td><small>
Sent to notify some status change of a client we are wathing.  The 
SILC_COMMAND_WATCH is used to manage clients we are wathing and this 
notify type is used to deliver information about that client.  If the 
client just changed nickname the 'new_nickname' includes the new nickname.  
Otherwise this pointer is NULL.  The 'user_mode' is the client's mode in 
the SILC network.  The 'notification' contains the notify type that 
happened for the 'watched_client' (for example 
SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_NICK_CHANGE if the client changed their nickname).

<br />&nbsp;<br />
SILC protocol defines some additional notify types but those notify types 
are not delivered to the application.  Some of those notify types are only 
delivered between servers and routers and clients never receive them.  
Only the notify types listed above are delivered to application.
