<big><b>Command Reply Arguments</b></big>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The SILC Client Library 'command_reply client operation (which is part of the
<a href="silcclient-SilcClientOperations.html">
SilcClientOperation</a> callback functions) returns command replies
from the SILC Server for commands that the client has earlier sent to the
server.  The 'command_reply' client operation implementation has a variable
argument list to deliver <a href="silccommand-SilcCommand.html">SilcCommand</a>
specific arguments to the application.  This document describes these
arguments for all command replies to help SILC client software developers
to process them.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>NOTE: </b>The following list of command reply arguments are sent when
the command was executed successfully.  If an error occurred, the
`command_reply' client operation's 'success' argument is FALSE, and the
'status' argument includes the error status.  In this case the arguments
returned are dependent of the 'status' argument.  See all
<a href="silcstatus_args.html">SilcStatus error arguments</a> for these
arguments.

<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>command_reply Client Library operation</b>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The 'command_reply' client operation callback function prototype is as follows:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
void (*command_reply)(SilcClient client, SilcClientConnection conn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SilcCommandPayload cmd_payload, bool success, SilcCommand command,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SilcStatus status, ...);
</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The first argument 'client' is the SILC Client Library context, the 'conn'
is the context for the connection to the remote server, the 'cmd_payload'
is the raw SilcCommandPayload and application usually ignores it, the
'success' boolean value indicates whether the earlier command was a success
or not, the 'command' is the command reply enumeration, and the 'status'
indicates the status of the command reply.  If 'success' is FALSE then
'status' includes error status (see <a href="silcstatus_args.html">SilcStatus
error arguments</a>).

<br />&nbsp;<br />
Rest of the arguments are 'command' specific and implementation should
handle them by the SilcCommand for example in a <tt>switch</tt> statement.
The commands are defined in lib/silccore/silccomand.h header file.  A short
example:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;switch(type)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case SILC_COMMAND_WHOIS:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case SILC_COMMAND_WHOWAS:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case SILC_COMMAND_NICK:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</tt>

<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>Arguments</b>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The following table describes all commands and arguments that the client
library sends in the 'command_reply' client operation to the application.
By default all arguments that the library sends to application are valid
pointers.  However, it is possible that some pointers may be NULL.  If
this is the case it is separately mentioned that the argument may be NULL.
In this case application must ignore that argument.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The 'command_reply' arguments for successful SilcCommand replies are as
follows:

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<table border="1" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

<tr>
<td><small>Name</td>
<td><small>Description</td>
<td width="50%"><small>Variable Arguments</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><small>SILC_COMMAND_WHOIS</td>
<td><small>
Returns information about user. The following pointers may be NULL: 'channels',
'fingerprint', 'channel_usermodes' and 'attrs'.  If 'fingerprint' is valid its
length is 20 bytes. If 'channels' is valid it can be parsed with
silc_channel_payload_parse_list function. It is the list of channels user
has joined. If the 'channel_usermodes' is valid it can be parsed with
silc_get_mode_list function. It is the list of the user's modes on the
joined channels. The 'attr' is the Requested Attributes that may have been
returned by the client and it can be parsed by traversing the SilcDList
and using silc_attribute_get_attribute function.

char *username, char *realname
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><small>SILC_COMMAND_IDENTIFY</td>
<td><small>
Returns information about user, channel or server.  This is similar to
WHOIS command but does not return so much information and can be used to
get information about channels and servers too.  Application should ignore
this command reply.  The 'name' and 'info' may be NULL.
</td>
<td width="50%"><small>void *entry, char *name, char *info
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><small>SILC_COMMAND_NICK</td>
<td><small>
Returns the new Client ID and new nickname inside the SilcClientEntry.
The `old_client_id' is the odl Client ID used by the client before the
nickname was changed.

<td width="50%"><small>SilcClientEntry local_entry, char *nickname,
const SilcClientID *old_client_id
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><small>SILC_COMMAND_LIST</td>
<td><small>
Returns the list of channel in the SILC network. Each call of command reply
returns one channel. This means that the command reply is called multiple
times to return list of channels.  The 'channel_topic' may be NULL.
</td>
<td width="50%"><small>SilcChannelEntry channel, char *channel_name,
char *channel_topic, SilcUInt32 user_count

<tr>
<td><small>SILC_COMMAND_INVITE</td>
<td><small>
Returns the invite list of the channel.  Called also even if invite list
was not modified but SILC_COMMAND_INVITE command was used to invite a user
into a channel.  In this case the invite list is not returned by the
server and 'invite_list' is NULL.  The 'invite_list' is list of
SilcArgumentPayloads.  The first 2 bytes are the number of arguments in
the list and can be parsed with SILC_GET16_MSB macro.  The list can be
parsed with silc_argument_payload_parse function.
</td>

<td><small>
Returns network statistics from the server.  The 'stats_buffer' of length of
'buffer_length' bytes includes 32-bit integers one after the other each
representing some statistics.  The integers can be parsed for example with
SILC_GET32_MSB macro.  The integers in the buffer are: starttime, uptime,
local_clients, local_channels, local_serverops, local_routerops, cell_clients,
cell_channels, cell_servers, all_clients, all_channel, all_servers,
all_routers, all_serverops, all_routerops.  All integers are always present.

to this reply.
</td>
<td width="50%"><small>none
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><small>SILC_COMMAND_JOIN</td>
<td><small>
Reply received when user joined a channel.  The 'ignored' argument can
be ignored by the application.  The 'topic' and 'hmac_name' may be NULL.
The 'key_payload' is usually ignored by the application.  The 'list_count'
is the number of entries in both 'client_id_list' and 'client_mode_list'.
The 'client_id_list' is a list of clients on the channel and 'client_mode_list'
includes those clients' modes on the channel.  If application likes to
resolve information about the clients on the channel it may call
silc_client_get_clients_by_list function and pass the 'client_id_list' as
argument to it.  The 'client_mode_list' includes 32-bit integers one after
the other and they are in same order as clients in 'client_mode_list'.
If application resolves the information with silc_client_get_clients_by_list
parsing the 'client_mode_list' is not necessary.  The 'founder_key' is the
channel founder's key and may be NULL.  The 'channel_pubkeys' is Argument
List Payload containing Public Key Payloads of all added channel public
keys, it may be NULL.

SILC protocol defines some additional commands but command replies to
those commands are not delivered to the application.  Only the command
replies listed above are delivered to application.
