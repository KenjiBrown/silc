<big><b>Unicode and UTF-8 Strings in Client Library</b></big>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
This document describes how the client library handles UTF-8 encoded
strings.  By default all strings in the SILC protocol are UTF-8 encoded.
All strings that are sent to server and strings that are received from the
server are always UTF-8 encoded.  It is application's responsibility to
render the strings as well as possible on the user interface.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
Exception to these strings are messages sent and received in
<a href="silcmessage-SilcMessagePayload.html">Message Payload</a>, which
can include practically any kind of strings with any kind of character
encodings, and binary data also.  If UTF-8 encoded message is sent
or received it is indicated with the SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_UTF8, and
application can render the messages accordingly.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
Other strings are always UTF-8 encoded and application needs to decode
the strings to other character encoding if application does not support
UTF-8 rendering on user interface.  Also strings application sends to
library, such as, nicknames, channel names, server names, host names,
topic srings, any command argument, etc. must always be UTF-8 encoded
before they are sent to the library.  The <a href="silcutf8.html">UTF-8
routines</a> help the application developer to encode and decode
UTF-8 strings.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The client library does not ever encode or decode strings to or from the
current locale.  The library always expects that all strings it receives
from application are already UTF-8 encoded.  The library may validate
certain UTF-8 strings and return error if needed.  Server may also
send errors in command reply if strings are not encoded properly.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
Nicknames and channel names in SILC are also UTF-8 encoded and can
include practically any kind of letters, numbers and punctuation
marks.  Control characters and other special characters are not allowed
in nickname strings, and application never receives such nicknames
or channel names from the library.
