<big><b>SilcStatus Arguments</b></big>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The <a href="silccore-SilcStatus.html">SilcStatus</a> is used to indicate
a status (usually error status) of command execution and command reply
status.  It is also used to deliver disconnection status when server
disconnects client from the server.  For application it is mainly important
in case of `command_reply' client operation, where the SilcStatus indicates
the error status of the command that was executed.  If error occurred the
arguments returned by the `command_reply' are then dependent of the SilcStatus
type instead of the <a href="command_reply_args.html">SilcCommand
arguments</a>.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
This documents describes how the application should interpret the SilcStatus
type in the `command_reply' client operation to be able to handle all
error conditions properly.  Any status type can be returned for any
SilcCommand.  For this reason application should be able to handle any
error with any command.


<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>Error Status In command_reply Client Operation</b>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
When error occurs in execution of a command the `command_reply' client
operation is called with error status.  In this case the 'success'
argument of the client operation is set to FALSE, to indicate that command
execution failed, and the 'status' argument indicates the error.
If the 'status' argument is SILC_STATUS_OK then error did not occur and the
arguments are as described in <a href="command_reply_args.html">SilcCommand
arguments</a>.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
Application should handle the error status arguments by the SilcStatus
type for example in a <tt>switch</tt> statement.  The SilcStatus values
are defined in lib/silccore/silcstatus.h header file.  A short example.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;switch(status)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case SILC_STATUS_ERR_NO_SUCH_NICK:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nick = va_arg(va, char *);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case SILC_STATUS_ERR_NO_SUCH_CHANNEL:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case SILC_STATUS_ERR_NO_SUCH_SERVER:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;default:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</tt>


<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>Arguments</b>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The following table describes all status values and arguments that the client
library sends in the 'command_reply' client operation to the application
in case of error.  All arguments listed below are usually valid when
returned by the library.  However applicationn must be able to handle that
any of those arguments may be NULL.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
The 'command_reply' arguments in case of error are as follows:

SILC protocol defines some additional status types but those status
types are not returned in `command_reply' client operation.  Only
the status types listed above are delivered to application.
