Installing SILC Developer's Version
===================================

./configure
./make

You should not install the SILC into your system, instead, you should
run it from the current directory.

To see different compilation options, give,

./configure --help


Generally, developers wants to compile with debugging, in this case,
give,

./configure --enable-debug

WARNING: The debugging is very very heavy and you currently cannot turn
it off if you have compiled it with this option.  However, if you're
going to develop or debug SILC you should compile with this option.
