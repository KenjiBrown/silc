There are two possibilities, if you have a system that supports
auto configuration (most Unix systems), then use:

  ./configure
  make
  make docall

become root and do

  make install


If your system does not support auto-configuration, then
have a look at  Source/makefile.plain  
you can build robodoc with


  make -f makefile.plain 


Additional documentation is provided in Docs/, in the form of
robodoc.html.  For a good example of how to use ROBODoc see the
ROBODoc source code.  To see what kind of documentation can
generated with ROBODoc, change to Source/ and do a

  make xhtml
  make example

or

  make -f makefile.plain example

It assumes you have netscape installed.

If you want to see the LaTeX documentation use
   make xtex
   make texview
   gv ROBODoc_mi.ps


Also have a look at the example makefile in the Docs/ directory.


Have fun,
Frans.
