<h2>Features</h2>
<font size=4>
<p>

Features to be included into the final release of SILC.
<p>

<li>Normal conferencing services such as private messages, channels,
   channel messages, etc.  All traffic is secured and authenticated.
<p>
<li>No unique nicknames.  There can be same nicknames in SILC without
   collisions.  SILC has unique Client ID's, Server ID's and Channel ID's
   to assure that there are no collisions.  The maximum length of the
   nickname is 128 characters.  The maximum length of the channel name
   is 256 characters.
<p>
<li>Channels can have channel operators and a channel founder which is the
    client who created the channel.  Channel founder privileges supersedes
    the channel operator privileges.  Also, channel founder privileges
    may be regained even if the founder leaves the channel.  The
    requirement for this is that the client is connected to the same
    server it was originally connected.  The channel founder cannot
    be removed from the channel by force.
<p>
<li>Channel messages are protected by channel key, generated by the
    server.  The key is re-generated once in an hour.  It is
    possible to set a private key for the channel so that even the
    servers does not know the key.  Actually, it is possible to set
    several private keys so that only specific users on the channel may
    decrypt some specific messages.  Adding the private key significantly
    increases the security as nobody else but the users on the channel
    knows the key. 
<p>
<li>Private messages are protected using the session keys, generated
    when connecting to the server.  This means that the private messages
    are decrypted and re-encrypted enroute to the true receiver of the
    message.  However, it is possible to set a private key between two
    clients and protect the private messages with that key.  In this case
    no server enroute can decrypt the message since they don't have
    the key.  The SILC protocol provides an automatic key negotiation
    between two clients using the SKE protocol.  This makes it very
    easy to negotiate a shared secret key with another client in the
    network.
<p>
<li>All the other traffic, like commands between client and the server
    are protected using the session keys.  Session keys are re-generated
    once in an hour.  The re-key may be done with or without the PFS
    (Perfect Forward Secrecy).
<p>
<li>Secure key exchange and authentication protocol.  SILC Key Exchange
   (SKE) protocol provides key material used in the SILC sessions in
   secure manner.  The protocol is immune for example to man-in-the-middle 
   attacks and is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.  The
   SILC Authentication protocol provides strong 
   authentication.  Authentication may be based on passphrase or public
   key (RSA) authentication.  For clients there is an option not to
   use authentication when connecting to servers.
<p>
<li>All traffic is encrypted and authenticated using the best cryptographic
   algorithms out there.  Cipher keys are, by default, 256 bits in length and
   public keys, by default, 1024 bits in length.
<p>
<li>Supports the following ciphers: AES, Twofish, Blowfish, Mars,
   Cast-256, RC5 and RC6.  Supports the following hash functions: MD5 and
   SHA1.  Supports the PKCS #1 (RSA) for public key cryptography.
<p>
<li>Supports data compression with GZIP to improve performance.
<p>
<li>SIM (SILC Module) support.  Support for loading of shared objects at 
   run-time that provides new and extended features to both SILC client
   and server.  These can provide extra ciphers and extra features to
   the software.
<p>
<li>SILC client can be installed and used without root privileges.
<p>
<li>SILC client can be configured by system wide configuration files but
   with user specific configuration files as well.
