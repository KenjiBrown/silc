<h1>About SILC</h1>
<p>
SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a protocol which provides
secure conferencing services in the Internet over insecure channel.
SILC is IRC like softwarre although internally they are very different.
Biggest similiarity between SILC and IRC is that they both provide
conferencing services and that SILC has almost same commands as IRC.  Other
than that they are nothing alike.  Biggest differences are that SILC is 
secure what IRC is not in any way.  The network model is also entirely
different compared to IRC.

<p>
SILC is an open source (or freeware) project and it has been released
under the GNU General Public Licence.  The SILC is free to use and everyone
is free to distribute and change the SILC under the terms of the GNU GPL.
While there is no guarantee for the product SILC has been tried make
as secure as possible.  The fact that the software and the protocol is
open for public analysis is a good thing for end user.
<p>
Protocol specification of SILC protocol is available for
anyone to look at. There exists three Internet Drafts that has been
submitted to <a href="http://www.ietf.org">IETF</a>. 
See <a href="docs.html">documentation page</a> for more information.
