<h1>About SILC</h1>
<p>
SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a protocol which provides
secure conferencing services in the Internet over insecure channel.
SILC is IRC like softwarre although internally they are very different.
Biggest similiarity between SILC and IRC is that they both provide
conferencing services and that SILC has almost same commands as IRC.  Other
than that they are nothing alike.  Biggest differences are that SILC is 
secure what IRC is not in any way.  The network model is also entirely
different compared to IRC.
