<h1>SILC Documentation</h1>
<p>
Currently the SILC documentation is under work and the software does not
have that much of a documentation.
<p>
README file from the software: <a href="docs/README">README</a>

<h1>SILC Protocol Internet Drafts</h1>
<p>
SILC Protocol is documented and three Internet Drafts exists. These 
Internet Drafts has been submitted, also, to the
<a href="http://www.ietf.org">IETF</a>.
<p>
<li>Secure Internet Live Conferencing (SILC), Protocol Specification
<p>
Abstract
<p>
This memo describes a Secure Internet Live Conferencing (SILC)
protocol which provides secure conferencing services over insecure
network channel.  SILC is IRC [IRC] like protocol, however, it is 
not equivalent to IRC and does not support IRC.  Strong cryptographic
methods are used to protect SILC packets inside SILC network.  Two
other Internet Drafts relates very closely to this memo;  SILC Packet
Protocol [SILC2] and SILC Key Exchange and Authentication Protocols
[SILC3].

<li>SILC Packet Protocol
<p>
Abstract
<p>
This memo describes a Packet Protocol used in the Secure Internet Live
Conferencing (SILC) protocol specified in the Secure Internet Live
Conferencing, Protocol Specification Internet Draft [SILC1].  This
protocol describes the packet types and packet payloads which defines
the contents of the packets.  The protocol provides secure binary packet
protocol that assures that the contents of the packets are secured and
authenticated.

<li>SILC Key Exchange and Authentication Protocols
<p>
Abstract
<p>
This memo describes two protocols used in the Secure Internet Live
Conferencing (SILC) protocol specified in the Secure Internet Live
Conferencing, Protocol Specification internet-draft [SILC1].  The
SILC Key Exchange (SKE) protocol provides secure key exchange between
two parties resulting into shared secret key material.  The protocol
is based on Diffie Hellman key exchange algorithm and its functionality
is derived from several key exchange protocols.  SKE uses best parts
of the SSH2 Key Exchange protocol, Station-To-Station (STS) protocol
and the OAKLEY Key Determination protocol [OAKLEY].
<p>
The SILC Connection Authentication protocol provides user level
authentication used when creating connections in SILC network.  The
protocol is transparent to the authentication data which means that it
can be used to authenticate the user with, for example, passphrase
(pre-shared- secret) or public key (and certificate).
