<h1>Contributing</h1>
<p>
Developers are needed in SILC project.  Everyone who has the time and
ability is welcome to come and join the project.  We need C coders,
technical writers (to write documentation) and web administrator to take
over these web pages.  Feel free to start narrowing down the TODO
list.
<p>
Interested people are also welcome to give new ideas to the SILC protocol
that is still in its draft phase.  You should probably go and read the
SILC protocol specification Internet Drafts to get the idea about what
SILC actually is.  The current software version might not give the
whole picture of the SILC.  The Internet Drafts are available in
<a href="docs.html">documentation page.</a>
<p>
Who wants to send code to the project should read the <a 
href="docs/CodingStyle">CodingStyle</a>
documentation.  New code must comply with the coding style conventions
described in that document.
<p>
There is anonymous CVS acccess for those who want to participate the
development process. Go see the <a href="cvs.html">CVS page.</a>
