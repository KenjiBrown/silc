<br />&nbsp;<br />
Are you confused with SILC? Don't quite know where to get some more 
information? If you answer Yes, then this is the door you're looking for.  
This page includes introduction to the help resources for SILC Network. 
There are many places where you can get more information and help 
regarding SILC in general, using SILC Network, developing SILC and much 
more.

<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>Getting Started with SILC</b>
<br />&nbsp;<br />
The very first thing you need to do to get online with SILC is to download 
the SILC client.  Go to the <a href="?page=download" class="normal">download
page</a>, and download the latest client.  There are several binary 
packages available if you do not want to compile the client by yourself.   
After you have your very own SILC client downloaded then locate the SILC 
server nearest to you.  Please see our <a href="?page=servers" 
class="normal">server list</a>, for all servers in the SILC Network.  You 
can also directly connect to the <samp 
class="highlight">silc.silcnet.org</samp> server if you like.
<br />&nbsp;<br />
You most likely have questions about SILC after you start using it.  The 
best place to look for questions and answers is the <a 
href="?page=faq" class="normal">SILC FAQ</a>. Please read it before you 
start asking more questions.

<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>Getting Help Online</b>
<br />&nbsp;<br />
The best and quickest way to get assistance is to get online on SILC 
Network.  If you have questions, or just want to chat about SILC you can 
join the <samp class="highlight">#silc</samp> channel. This friendly 
channel includes people who are interested in SILC and ready to answer 
questions assuming they know the answers.
<br />&nbsp;<br />
Give the command <samp class="highlight">/join #silc</samp> to join the 
channel. Please introduce yourself before asking the question, and wait 
patiently for your answer.

<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>Getting Help On This Website</b>
<br />&nbsp;<br />
Reading documentation on SILC is also a good way to learn about SILC.  See 
the documentation available in the <a href="?page=docs" 
class="normal">documentation page</a> for more information.

<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
<b>Getting Help via Mailing Lists</b>
<br />&nbsp;<br />
There is currently one mailing list called silc-devel.  This is 
general purpose mailing list that includes conversation on SILC 
development, announcements of new releases and provides help for anyone 
who ask questions.  You can subscribe to the mailist list on the <a 
href="?page=lists" class="normal">lists page</a>, and read the archives of 
the mailing list at <a 
href="http://www.geocrawler.com/redir-sf.php3?list=silc-devel" 
class="normal">silc-devel archives</a>.  You can send email to the mailing 
list by sending it to <samp class="highlight">
silc-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</samp> email address.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
Before you go ahead and start sending questions there is a nice document 
about <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" 
class="normal">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a> by Eric S. Raymond, 
a document you may want to read.
