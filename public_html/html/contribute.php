Developers are needed in SILC project. Everyone who has the time and
ability is welcome to join the project.  We need C coders and technical
writers (to write documentation). Feel free to start narrowing down the <a href="?page=todo" class="normal">TODO</a> list.
<br />&nbsp;<br />
Interested people are also welcome to give new ideas to the SILC protocol
that is still in its draft phase. You should probably go and read the SILC
protocol specification Internet Drafts to get the idea about what SILC
actually is. The current software version might not give the whole picture
of the SILC. The Internet Drafts are available in
<a href="?page=docs" class="normal">documentation page.</a>
<br />&nbsp;<br />
Who wants to send code to the project should read the <a 
href="docs/CodingStyle" class="normal">CodingStyle</a>
documentation. New code must comply with the coding style conventions
described in that document.
<br />&nbsp;<br />
There is anonymous CVS acccess for those who want to participate the
development process. See the <a href="?page=cvs" class="normal">CVS page.</a>
