<b><big>Contributing</big></b>
<br />&nbsp;<br />
Developers are needed in SILC project. Everyone who has the time and
ability is welcome to join the project.  We need C coders and technical
writers (to write documentation). Feel free to start narrowing down the <a href="?page=todo" class="normal">TODO</a> list.
<br />&nbsp;<br />
Interested people are also welcome to give new ideas to the SILC protocol
that is still in its draft phase. You should probably go and read the SILC
protocol specification Internet Drafts to get the idea about what SILC
actually is. The current software version might not give the whole picture
of the SILC. The Internet Drafts are available in
<a href="?page=docs" class="normal">documentation page.</a>
<br />&nbsp;<br />
Who wants to send code to the project should read the <a 
href="docs/CodingStyle" class="normal">CodingStyle</a>
documentation. New code must comply with the coding style conventions
described in that document.
<br />&nbsp;<br />
There is anonymous CVS acccess for those who want to participate the
development process. See the <a href="?page=cvs" class="normal">CVS page.</a>

<b>Submitting Patches to Mailing List</b>
<br />&nbsp;<br />
Please follow these instructions when you are submitting a patch to the 
silc-devel mailing list.

<br />&nbsp;<br />
 <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0" border="0">
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
Use the unified output format for the diff (diff -u)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
Use diff, not cvs diff
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
Send the patch to the mailing list, and add those people that should know
about it on CC:
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
Submit ready patches. If they are not ready then sending them to
people who are involved in the development is preferred. The patch might 
face several round trips so sending patches which are ready is preffered
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
Include the patch in the body of the email or attach it
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
Send separate patches for every bugfix or feature
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
If you think that your work is benefical to the development of the
SILC and would like to be listed in the CREDITS file in SILC packages, you
can submit patches for the CREDITS file too. Nobody will be added there
without a patch, this way those who don't want to see their name there 
won't get there
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
Do not submit bugs ;)
</td></tr>
