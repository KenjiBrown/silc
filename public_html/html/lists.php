<b>Basic instructions for submitting patches</b>
<br />&nbsp;<br />

<table>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
use the unified output format for the diff (diff -u)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
use diff, not cvs diff
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
send the patch to the mailing list, and add those people that should know
about it on CC:
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
submit ready patches. if they are not ready then sending them to
people who are involved in the development is preferred. the patch might face
several round trips so sending patches which are ready is preffered
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
include the patch in the body of the email or attach it
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
send separate patches for every bugfix or feature
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
if you think that your work is benefical to the development of the
SILC and would like to be listed in the CREDITS file in SILC packages, you
can submit patches for the CREDITS file too. Nobody will be added there
without a patch, this way those who don't want to see their name there won't
get there
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"> - </td><td>
do not submit bugs ;)
</td></tr>
