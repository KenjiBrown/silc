@SYNTAX:watch@

This command is used to add nicknames to your watch list in the server.
When the watched nickname appears in the network, leaves the network
or its user mode is changed you will be notified for this change.  This
same command can be used also to remove nicknames from being watched.

Note that some users may have a user mode set that rejects you from
receiving notifications about them.  Also note that since nicknames are
not unique it is possible that same nickname matches several users in
the network.  In this case you will receive notifications about all
of those users.

Examples:

    /WATCH -add foobar
    /WATCH -del foobar
