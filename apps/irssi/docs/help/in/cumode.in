@SYNTAX:cumode@

This command is used to manage the client's modes on the channel.
Most of the modes require that the client which changes some
client's mode must be channel founder or channel operator.  The
mode is added by adding + before the option(s) and removed by
adding - before the option(s).  The following channel user modes
are available:

    a <nickname>[@<server>]

        Set/unset all modes (cannot be used to set
        both founder and operator rights, can be used
        only to remove both modes at once).

    f <nickname>[@<server>] [-pubkey|<password>]

        Set/Unset channel founder.  If the -pubkey
        option or <password> is provided then the
        client is claiming the founder rights by
        providing the channel founder authentication
        data.  If the -pubkey is provided then the
        authentication is performed using the
        client's public key.  If you are channel
        founder you can set the channel founder
        authentication using CMODE command.

    o <nickname>[@<server>]

        Set/unset channel operator.  Requires that 
        you are channel operator or channel founder.
