This command is used to manage the client's modes on the channel.
Most of the modes require that the client which changes some
client's mode must be channel founder or channel operator.  The
mode is added by adding + before the option(s) and removed by
adding - before the option(s).  The following channel user modes
are available:

    a <nickname>[@<server>]

        Set/unset all modes (cannot be used to set
        both founder and operator rights, can be used
        only to remove both modes at once).

    f <nickname>[@<server>]
