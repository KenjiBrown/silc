@SYNTAX:cumode@

This command is used to manage the users modes on the channel.
Most of the modes require that the user which changes some
other user's mode must be channel founder or channel operator.  The
mode is added by adding + before the option(s) and removed by
adding - before the option(s).  The following channel user modes
are available:

    a <nickname>[@<server>]

        Set/unset all modes (cannot be used to set
        both founder and operator rights, can be used
        only to remove both modes at once).

    f <nickname>[@<server>]
      [<pubkeyfile> <privkeyfile> [<privkey passphrase>]]

        Set/Unset channel founder.  If you are channel
        founder you can set the channel founder authentication
        using CMODEc command.

        If the <pubkeyfile> and <privkeyfile> is
        provided then the <pubkeyfile> will the used
        as founder public key, and the private key
        is used to compute a signature for the SILC
        server.  If these are omitted then the default
        SILC keypair is used.  Normally you do not need
        to provide these arguments.

    o <nickname>[@<server>]

        Set/unset channel operator.  Requires that 
        you are channel operator or channel founder.

    b <nickname>[@<server>]

        Set/unset channel message blocking.  Client
        may set this mode only to itself.  When set
        the server will not send channel message to
        to the client.  This mode can be used to block
        unwanted messages if desired.

    u <nickname>[@<server>]

        Set/unset channel message blocking for messages
        sent by normal users.  When set the server will
        only deliver messages sent by channel founder or
        channel operator.  Client may set this mode only
        to itself.

    r <nickname>[@<server>]

        Set/unset channel message blocking for messages
        sent by robots.  When set the server will not
        deliver message from users that has been marked
        as robots.  Client may set this mode only to
        itself.

    q <nickname>[@<server>]

        Set/unset user as quiet.  When set the user cannot
        talk on the channel, and cannot send messages to
        the channel.  This can be used by channel operator
        to queit a certain misbehaving user.  The user cannot
        unset this mode itself.  This mode cannot be set
        or unset to yourself.
