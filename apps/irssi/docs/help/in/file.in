@SYNTAX:file@

This command is used to tranfer files between clients.
The actual file transfer stream is sent outside SILC network
peer to peer between the clients.  Before the file transfer
begins the SILC Key Exchange protocol is performed between
the two clients to exchange key material.  This key material
is then used to secure the file transfer stream between the
clients.

The currently active file transfer sessions can be seen by
giving the FILE command without arguments.

Commands:

    SEND     <filepath> <nickname> [<local IP> [<local port>]]

      Sends file transfer request to <nickname>.  This
      makes the <filepath> available to <nickname>.

      If the <local IP> is provided then the key exchange
      protocol listener will be bound to that address.  If
      <local port> is defined it is bound to that port. 
      If they are not defined then the local IP address
      of your machine is used to bind the listener.  If that
      fails then the <nickname> is assumed to provide the
      listener.  If you do not know whether you need to
      provide <local IP> or not, do not provide it.

    RECEIVE  [<nickname>]

      Accepts the file transfer request and starts
      the file transfer session.  If the <nickname> is
      omitted the last received request is used.

    CLOSE    [<nickname>]

      Closes the file transfer session, or rejects
      file transfer request.  If this command is given
      during the file transfer process it will be cancelled.
