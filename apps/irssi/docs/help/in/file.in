@SYNTAX:file@

This command is used to tranfer files between clients.
The actual file transfer stream is sent outside SILC network
peer to peer between the clients.  Before the file transfer
begins the SILC Key Exchange protocol is performed between
the two clients to exchange key material.  This key material
is then used to secure the file transfer stream between the
clients.

The currently active file transfer sessions can be seen by
giving the FILE command without arguments.

Commands:

    SEND       <filepath> <nickname>

      Sends file transfer request to <nickname>.  This
      makes the <filepath> available to <nickname>.

    RECEIVE    [<nickname>]

      Accepts the file transfer request and starts
      the file transfer session.  If the <nickname> is
      omitted the last received request is used.

    CLOSE      [<nickname>]

      Closes the file transfer session, or rejects
      file transfer request.  If this command is given
      during the file transfer process it will be cancelled.
