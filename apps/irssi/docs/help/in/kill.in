@SYNTAX:kill@

This command can be used for two purpose:  SILC operator may use it
to remove a client from the network, or user may use it to remove
its own client entries from the network.

If you are not SILC operator you cannot use this command to remove
anybody else except yourself from the network.  Only SILC operator
is able to kill other clients from the network.  When killing your
own client entry you must provide -pubkey argument to the command.
For killing your own client from network you also must be connected
to the same server as your own client entry (the client entry may
be for example detached client entry).  When using this command as
SILC operator -pubkey has no effect.

Examples:

        /KILL myself -pubkey

            Kill yourself with nickname "myself" from network.

        /SILCOPER user
        /KILL someclient You have been killed

            Become SILC operator and kill client named
            "someclient", with comment "You have been killed".
