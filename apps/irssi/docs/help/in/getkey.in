@SYNTAX:getkey@

This command is used to fetch remote client's or server's public
key.  When fetching client's public key it is fetched from the
server the client is connected to.  This way the public key might
have been verified already.  However, you will be prompted to verify
the fetched public key.  The public key is saved into your
local key directory (~/.silc/clientkeys/).
