@SYNTAX:getkey@

Format: <nickname>

This command is used to fetch remote client's public key.
The public key is fetched from the server the client is
connected to.  This way the public key might have been
verified already.  However, you will be prompted to verify
the fetched public key.  The public key is saved into your
local key directory (~/.silc/clientkeys/).
