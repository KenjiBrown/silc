@SYNTAX:cmode@

This command is used to manage the modes of the channel.  Most
of the modes require special privileges, such as channel operator
or channel founder privileges to work.  The mode is added by
adding + before the option(s) and removed by adding - before the
option(s).  The following modes are available:

    p               Set/unset channel as private channel
    s               Set/unset channel as secret channel
    k               Set/unset that channel uses private channel key
    i               Set/unset channel as invite only channel
    t               Set/unset that only channel operator or 
                    founder may set channel topic
    l <limit>       Set/unset channel's user limit
    a <passphrase>  Set/unset passphrase for channel that must
                    be provided when joining to the channel.
    c <cipher>      Set/unset channel's cipher
    h <hmac>        Set/unset channel's hmac
    f <-pubkey|<password>
                    Set/unset channel founder authentication.
                    Channel founder may set this mode so that
                    if the client leaves the channel it can
                    claim the founder rights when it returns
                    to the channel.  If -pubkey is set then
                    the authentication will be done using the
                    client's public key.  You can claim the
                    founder rights using the CUMODE command.

Multiple modes can be set/unset at once if the modes does not
require any arguments.  If mode requires an argument then only
one mode can be set at once.
