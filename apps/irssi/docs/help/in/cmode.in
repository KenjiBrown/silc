@SYNTAX:cmode@

This command is used to manage the modes of the channel.  Most
of the modes require special privileges, such as channel operator
or channel founder privileges to work.  The mode is added by
adding + before the option(s) and removed by adding - before the
option(s).  The following modes are available:

    p               Set/unset channel as private channel
    s               Set/unset channel as secret channel
    k               Set/unset that channel uses private channel key
    i               Set/unset channel as invite only channel
    t               Set/unset that only channel operator or 
                    founder may set channel topic
    m               Set/unset user silencing.  Normal users
                    are not able to talk on channel.  Only
                    channel founder may set this mode
    M               Set/unset operator silencing.  Operators
                    are not able to talk on channel.  Only
                    channel founder may set this mode
    l <limit>       Set/unset channel's user limit
    a <passphrase>  Set/unset passphrase for channel that must
                    be provided when joining to the channel.
    c <cipher>      Set/unset channel's cipher
    h <hmac>        Set/unset channel's hmac
    f [<pubkeyfile> <privkeyfile> [<privkey passphrase>]]
                    Set/unset channel founder authentication.
                    Channel founder may set this mode so that
                    if the client leaves the channel it can
                    claim the founder rights when it returns
                    to the channel, and to set the channel to
                    be permanent channel.  You can claim the
                    founder rights using CUMODE or JOIN commands.

                    If the <pubkeyfile> and <privkeyfile> is
                    provided then the <pubkeyfile> will the used
                    as founder public key, and the private key
                    is used to compute a signature for the SILC
                    server.  If these are omitted then the default
                    SILC keypair is used.  Normally you do not need
                    to provide these arguments.

Multiple modes can be set/unset at once if the modes does not
require any arguments.  If mode requires an argument then only
one mode can be set at once.
