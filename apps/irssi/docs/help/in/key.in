@SYNTAX:key@

This command is used to set and unset private keys for
channels, set and unset private keys for private messages
with remote clients and to send key agreement requests and
negotiate the key agreement protocol with remote client.
The key agreement is supported only to negotiate private
message keys, it currently cannot be used to negotiate
private keys for channels, as it is not convenient for that
purpose.

Types:

  MSG        The command is performed for private messages
             affecting the <nickname>.

  CHANNEL    The command is performed for the channel indicated
             by <channel> (* matches current channel).

Commands:

  set        [<key> [<cipher>] [<hmac>]] [-responder]

    Set the key into use.  If the <key> is provided it is used
    as the key material.  If the <key> is not provided the
    negotiated key material is used.  If the negotiation has not
    been performed this command has no effect.

    If the type is MSG and the <key> is `*' then random key
    will be generated automatically.  The -responder option
    may be used ONLY with MSG type.  One of the clients must
    be the responder side.  The one being the responder must
    use this option.  The clients setting the key must agree
    on which one is the responder.

  unset      [<number>]

    Unset the key.  The private key is not used after this
    command.  The key must be set again or the key material must
    be re-negotiated to be able to use the private keys again.
    The channel may have several private keys set.  The <number>
    can be used to indicate what key is being unset.  If it is
    not provided all keys are removed.

  list

    List all private keys that has been set.  If the type is
    MSG and the <nickname> is ´*' then all private message
    keys that you've set will be listed.

  change     [<number>]

    This command can be used only when type is CHANNEL.  This is
    used to change the current channel private key.  The <number>
    may indicate what key is changed.  If it is not provided then
    next key is changed to current channel private key.  By default
    this command is also bound to Meta-K (Alt+Shift+k) key.

  agreement  [<hostname> [<port>]]

    Send key agreement request to remote client.  If the
    <hostname> is provided it is sent in the request. The
    receiver may use the hostname to start the key agreement.
    If the <port> is also provided your key agreement protocol
    server is bound to that port.  Note that it cannot be
    privileged port (<1024).  If the <hostname> and <port> is
    not provided then the receiver will never initiate the key
    agreement.  In this case you may start the key agreement
    after receiving the reply to the request, by giving the
    negotiate command.

    This command may be used to send reply to the remote client.
    When receiving empty key agreement you can reply to the
    sender with the hostname and port of your key agreement
    server with this command.

    If the hostname and port are ommitted, the irssi boolean
    variable use_auto_addr will be examined.  If it is set
    the value of auto_bind_ip will be used as the IP address
    to listen for the return reply, the value of auto_public_ip
    will be the IP address sent to the remote client, and the
    auto_bind_port will be the port value to be bound to and
    sent to the remote client.  If auto_public_ip is unset, but
    auto_bind_ip is set, irssi will send the auto_bind_ip
    variable's value to the remote client.

  negotiate  [<hostname> [<port>]]

    This may be called to start the key agreement with <nickname>.
    This command has effect only if the <nickname> has replied to
    your key agreement request.  You will see a notify on the
    screen when the reply arrives.  The <hostname> and <port> is the
    hostname and port of the remote client's key agreement server.

Examples:

  Set channel private key to current channel, and list all keys:

    /KEY CHANNEL set very_secret_key_this_is
    /KEY CHANNEL list
    /KEY MSG nickname set secretkey
    /KEY MSG nick set secretkey -responder
    /KEY MSG foo agreement 10.2.1.7 5000
    /KEY MSG bar negotiate 10.2.1.7 5000
