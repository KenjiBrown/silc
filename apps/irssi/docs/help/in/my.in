My information for WHOIS command

In SILC it is possible to retrieve detailed information about a user
with WHOIS command by giving -details option to the WHOIS.  This
information is retrieved directly from the client, if the client
supports it.  If client does not support it or do not want to send
anything then server may reply on behalf of the client.

You may set your personal information that others may retrieve using
WHOIS command.  These information is set with SET command, give command:

  SET my

to see all possible settings for the information.  By default, in SILC
Client sending the information is allowed.  If you do not want to allow
it give command:

   SET my_allow_request OFF

and your client will not reply to the requests.  This usually means that
server may not send you the request anymore at all, or may do so only
occasionally.
