@SYNTAX:msg@

Sends a private message to other user in the network.

It is possible to digitally sign your messages.  The receiver
may then verify the message with your public key.  By default
messages are not signed.  If you want your private messages 
to be signed you SMSG command instead of this MSG command.

If -channel option is provided then this command actually
send channel message to the specified channel.  The message
IS NOT private message, it is normal channel message.  It is
also possible to digitally sign channel messages by using
SMSG command or by doing /set sign_channel_messages on, in
which case _all_ channel messages will be signed.

Example:

/MSG Toni Hi, what's up?
