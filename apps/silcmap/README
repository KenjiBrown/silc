The SILC Map
============

SILC Map is a utility which can be used to visualize the topology of a
SILC network.  It can create maps which indicate the exact global position
of the servers and it can create HTML pages out of the information it 
gathers from the servers.  It is also possible to create a HTML map 
page which allows the user to click the servers on the map image to get
more detailed information of the server.  The links between the routers
and servers can also be drawn on the map image.

The HTML pages that SILC Map creates are by default crude looking.  This
is intentional feature to allow the user to easily embed the data pages
into existing web site.  This can be done for example by using PHP, server
side includes or similar method.


SILC Map Config File
====================

By default the SILC Map reads the silcmap.conf file.  Please read the
example silcmap.conf file to learn all the possible commands and 
configuration options you can use to alter the behavior of the SILC Map.


Running the SILC Map
====================

After you have configured the silcmap.conf file, simply run the ./silcmap
program.  It reads the file, the source map image, creates the connections
to SILC servers and producess the target image and HTML pages.  After the
map is created the silcmap program exits.  If you want to periodically run 
the silcmap to generate maps you may create for example an at (see at(1)) 
job on your local system.


Getting Map Images
==================

We do not distribute any map images with the SILC Map package.  However,
you may download map images for free from NASA at:
