manpagedescription()
SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a secure conferencing network.
bf(Silc) is the SILC client which is used to connect to SILC server and
the SILC network.  The silc client resembles IRC clients to make the
using easier for new users.

bf(Silc) supports sending of practically any kind of messages in addition
of normal text messages in the SILC network.  The session to SILC server
is secured with session key, channel messages are protected with channel
key and private messages with session keys.  It is also possible to use
private channel keys and private message keys in addition of channel
generated keys.

bf(Silc) supports em(passphrase) and public key authentication based on
em(digital signatures), when connecting to SILC server.  bf(Silc) also supports
key exchange (key agreement) between other bf(Silc) users in the SILC
network to negotiate secret key material.  This key material then can be
used to secure for example private messages.  It is also possible to exchange
public keys and certificates in the SILC network between clients and servers.

The bf(silc) also supports em(detaching) from the SILC network by closing
the connection to the server but without quitting from the network.  Next
time the bf(silc) connects to the server it em(resumes) the session in the
SILC network.  During the detaching the user remains in the network and other
users may query the user information and see that user is in network but
currently detached.  Messages sent to user while being detached are
dropped by the server.  When resuming is over the user has automatically
same nickname than before detaching and remains on all channels, and it
seems like user never left the network.

The bf(silc) also supports creation of em(friends) list, which is kind of
buddy list familiar from IM (Instant Messaging) clients.  By using the
bf(WHOIS) SILC command with em(-details) option it possible to fetch the
user's information such as their public keys and certificates, business
card, pictures, and other information and save them to the friends list.
The friends list is located at bf(~/.silc/friends/) directory.

The SILC public key and private key pair is used to authenticate the user
to the SILC server when connecting a server.  This key pair is created
automatically when the bf(silc) is run for the first time.  It also can
be created with bf(-C) option.

When connecting for the first time to SILC server, user will be asked to
accept the server's public key.  When key is accepted the bf(silc) saves
the public key for future into bf(~/.silc/serverkeys/) directory.  The
next time user connects to same server the public key is verified against
the saved public key.  The purposeof this public key saving is to avoid
man-in-the-middle attacks which could be possible if the key would have
to be verified everytime user connects to the server.
