This directory includes example files for a small SILC network.  The
network consists of three (3) routers, and seven (7) servers.  One of
the cell also has a backup router too.  The topology of the network is
as follows:

Cell 1:
Router                212.146.42.250	cell1_router.conf
 Backup router        212.146.42.100	cell1_backup.conf
 Server1              212.146.42.101	cell1_server1.conf
 Server2              212.146.42.102	cell1_server2.conf

Cell 2:
Router                212.146.42.251	cell2_router.conf
 Server1              212.146.42.130	cell2_server1.conf
 Server2              212.146.42.131	cell2_server2.conf

Cell 3:
Router                212.146.42.252	cell3_router.conf
 Server1              212.146.42.150	cell3_server1.conf
 Server2              212.146.42.151	cell3_server2.conf

To make it simple all servers and routers use the same public and private
keys.  They are the silcd.pub and silcd.prv in this directory.  Also, to
make authentication simple all servers and routers authenticate themselves
to other routers by simple password.

Also note that the format in the configuration file is very raw so if you 
need any help to understand what some setting means please check the
documented example configuration files in doc/ directory.  Mainly, the
example_silcd.conf.

If you want to test this network you should change the IP addresses
in the configuration file or perhaps set IP aliases for you local
machine.
