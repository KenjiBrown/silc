# Distributions
#
# Distributions file describing the different distributions that are
# created out of the SILC source tree.  The ./prepare script will read
# this file to determine what kind of distributions are created.
#
# Give the name of the distribution and the version as arguments to the
# ./prepare script to prepare the source tree for the specific
# distribution.
#
# The format of this file is as follows:
#
# _<name>_SUBDIRS			Subdirs for the distribution
# _<name>_SUBDIRS_<dir>                 Subdirs under <dir>
# _<name>_DISTLABEL                     Preprocessor label
#
# DISTRBUTIONS=<distributions>
#
# The _SUBDIRS define all the subdirectories that the Makefile should
# traverse.  The _SUBDIRS_<dir> defines all subdirectories in the 
# subdirectory <dir>.  The _DISTLABEL defines a preprocessor label
# that can be used in the source code like `#ifdef SILC_DIST_CLIENT' to
# define code only for the specific distribution.  The label can also be
# used in the Makefiles by `if SILC_DIST_CLIENT' to define something in
# the Makefile only for the specific distribution.
#
# The DISTRIBUTIONS defines all distributions in this file.
#
# NOTE: For now this supports only one sublevel of the directories.
#       Also make sure that the <dir> directory includes Makefile.am.pre
#       instead of Makefile.am, otherwise it won't work.  The Makefile.am.pre
#       must have DIST_SUBDIRS = SILC_DISTRIBUTIONS_SUBDIRS line in it.
#
# NOTE: Also note that if any subdirectory has Makefile.am.pre then you
#       must list it here as _<name>_SUBDIRS_<dir>. To define all sub
#       directories use $(COMMONLIBS) that must be defined in the Makefile
#       and list all subdirs.
#
# Example:
#
# _xyz_SUBDIRS=lib irssi doc includes
# _xyz_SUBDIRS_lib=$(SUBDIRS)
# _xyz_DISTLABEL=SILC_DIST_XYZ
#
# To prepare the distribution give command ./prepare xyz 1.0.4
