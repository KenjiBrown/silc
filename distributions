#
# Distributions
#
# Distributions file describing the different distributions that are
# created out of the SILC source tree.  The ./prepare script will read
# this file to determine what kind of distributions are created.
#
# Give the name of the distribution and the version as arguments to the
# ./prepare script to prepare the source tree for the specific
# distribution.
#
# The format of this file is as follows:
#
# _<name>_SUBDIRS			Subdirs for the distribution
# _<name>_SUBIDRS_<dir>                 Subdirs under <dir>
#
# NOTE: For now this supports only one sublevel of the directories.
#       Also make sure that the <dir> directory includes Makefile.am.pre
#       instead of Makefile.am, otherwise it won't work.  The Makefile.am.pre
#       must have DIST_SUBDIRS = SILC_DISTRIBUTIONS_SUBDIRS line in it.
#
# NOTE: Also note that if any subdirectory has Makefile.am.pre then you
#       must list it here as _<name>_SUBDIRS_<dir> and either define the
#       directories one by one or use $(SUBDIRS) to use default to that
#       Makefile.  Otherwise, ./prepare cannot create correct Makefile.am.
#
# Example:
#
# _xyz_SUBDIRS=lib irssi doc includes
# _xyz_SUBDIRS_lib=$(SUBDIRS)
#
# To prepare the distribution give command ./prepare xyz 1.0.4
#

_toolkit_SUBDIRS=lib silc silcd doc includes
_toolkit_SUBDIRS_lib=$(SUBDIRS)

_client_SUBDIRS=lib irssi doc includes
_client_SUBDIRS_lib=$(SUBDIRS)

_server_SUBDIRS=lib silcd doc includes
