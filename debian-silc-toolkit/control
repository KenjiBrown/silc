Description: developer files for the SILC library (silc-toolkit)
 SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a network protocol designed
 to provide end-to-end security for conferencing services. SILC has a
 command set and a user interface similar to IRC, but the network
 protocol is completely different as it supports public key strong
 cryptography and a different network model.
 .
 This package contains headers and documentation for both the generic SILC
 library (libsilc) and the client library (libsilcclient).
